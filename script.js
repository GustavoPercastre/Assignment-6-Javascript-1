// 1. Say you have a function, primitiveMultiply, that in 20% of cases multiplies two
// numbers and in the other 80% of cases raises an exception of type
// MultiplicatorUnitFailure. Write a function that wraps this clunky function and just
// keeps trying until a call succeeds, after which it returns the result. Make sure you
// handle only the exceptions you are trying to handle.
// Example Output:
// console.log(reliableMultiply(8, 8)); // outputs 64
